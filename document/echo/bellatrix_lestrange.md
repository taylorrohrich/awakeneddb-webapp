Bellatrix's fighting style is like her admiration for Voldemort -- crazy and reckless.

#### The Fallen Bar

Every time you damage an opponent, your Fallen Bar will increase by 4 (and 1 if the target is not a fellow student). Filling up the Fallen Bar will summon 1 Death Eater. The bar will start to drop until it reaches 0, at which point the accumulation starts again.

#### Death Eater

Every time your Fallen Bar drops to 0, an additional Death Eater will be summoned next time if fills up. As many as 3 Death Eaters can be present at the same time. The Death Eaters' attributes will be based on the average level of your Deck and the rarity of your current Echo.
