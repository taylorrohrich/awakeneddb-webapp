Transforms you into a invincible Obscurus, launching 6 rapid Basic Attacks on random Enemy Units in the target area while briefly slowing them. After the attacks, the target zone explodes, dealing massive Damage to all Enemy Units inside and erasing the Obscurus status. You then return to your starting point.

- If there are no opponent units in the target area, the area will be detonated and the attack will end.
- When the Obscurus effect wears off, you are weakened and take 40% more damage for 5 seconds.
