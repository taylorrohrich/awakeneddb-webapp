Summons a Norwegian Ridgeback egg. When the egg reaches 100% Health, a Baby Norwegian Ridgeback will hatch, spewing fire at random enemies 3 times and dealing AoE Damage.

- The Egg starts with only 40% of its Max Health and regenerates 3% of its Max Health every second.
- If the Dragon Egg takes total Damage equal to 110% of its Max HP, it stops automatically regenerating Health.
