Casts a ring of fire around you, dealing damage to all enemy units that enter.

- Player units and future selves within the fire ring will charge it up. The more units there are, the faster it charges, up to a maximum of three charges.
- After completing a charge, a Fire Dragon will spawn and race towards the furthest opponent unit, dealing damage to all opponents in its path.
- Each charge spawns an extra Fire Dragon.
