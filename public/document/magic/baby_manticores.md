Imitates the movement of a Manticore for 10s, during which your Movement Speed is enhanced and not Movement Cards are spent (Apparition and Hagrid's Motorbike excluded). Control effects can interrupt this process. However, if uninterrupted throughout the duration, you will Encourage allies, increasing their Movement Speed. A baby Manticore will be Summoned to battle alongside you every 2.5s whilst the Spell is active.
