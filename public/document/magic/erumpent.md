Summons an Erumpent that dashes towards the nearest enemy (prioritising opponents). On impact, it explodes, dealing AoE Damage to both enemies and itself, and Stuns for 1 second.

- The explosion's AoE Damage also applies to the Erumpent.
- Explosion Damage increases with dash time. If the Erumpent has not hit an enemy within 6 seconds, it will directly explode.
