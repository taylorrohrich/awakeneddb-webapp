Summons a Phoenix which will continuously Heal Ally Units within range at the cost of its own Health.

- The Phoenix will leave a pile of ashes once its Health has been depleted, from which it will rise after a period of time. After three resurrections, the Phoenix will return to your Hand when its Health depleted again.
- The Phoenix's Max Health is reduced by 10% every time it is reborn.
