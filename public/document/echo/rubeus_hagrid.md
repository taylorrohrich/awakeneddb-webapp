Hagrid's love of magical creatures will greatly enhance Summons.

#### Summon Card Enhancement

Attack Speed of your highest-cost Summon is increased. Every time this Summon takes total damage equal to 50% of its Max Health, it will recover a percentage of its Max Health within 2s. This effect can be triggered up to 3 times. When multiple Summons share the same highest cost within the Deck, one will be randomly chosen.
